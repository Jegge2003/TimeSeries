# TimeSeries
Time series data refers to data that changes over time. They are usually indexed in time order. It can take forms like the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide over time, the waveform of the human voice, the fluctuation of the stock value over the year, or demographic information about a city. Time series data consist of 2 things:
An array of numbers that represent the data itself.
Another array that contains a timestamp for each data point.
The machine learning pipeline to be utilized in this blog for machine learning for time series data includes:
Feature extraction
Model fitting
Prediction and validation
In this blog, we will be using machine learning to forecast Energy Consumption which involves the use of time series data. The dataset is the American Electric Power.
